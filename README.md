## 🚀 About the Survey
This survey provides:
- A **comprehensive taxonomy** to Operating System Fuzzing.  
- **Unique technique details** in OS Fuzzing, and **fuzzing strategies** at different OS layers (e.g., Kernel, File System, Driver, Hypervisor)
- **Discussion of open challenges** and future directions in Open-Source Operating System Fuzzing.

We review general fuzzing compaign in Open-Source OS, as well as catagorize fuzzing details and challenges at different OS layers. We aim to keep this survey up to date with the latest developments in Open-Source OS Fuzzing.
